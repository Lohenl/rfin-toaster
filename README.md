# Toastbank. Simple as toast.

Team Toasters' Toastbank: A simple Angular PWA backed with AWS Amplify, Express JS temporarily parked here in case Winston decides to go mad with K8's.

For a certain hackathon.

## Demo

The PWA demo is hosted in AWS Amplify here: https://dev.d3nq2ydtcm5yeo.amplifyapp.com/

The Express webapp is hosted within AWS Lambda as a severless backend for the PWA, because working with Angular requires a proxy server in order to work (because of CORS), so fice hours have been spent rewriting proxy routes to whatever was provided in the Mambu API Postman collection.
