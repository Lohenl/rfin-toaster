# Toastbank. Simple as toast.

Team Toasters' Toastbank: A simple Angular PWA developed with and deployed on AWS Amplify.

The Express webapp is hosted in AWS Lambda as a severless backend for the PWA - working with Angular requires a proxy server in order to work with external APIs (because of CORS), so five hours were spent rewriting proxy routes to whatever was provided in the Mambu API Postman collection.

For a certain fintech hackathon.
